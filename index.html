					<h2>What we want to do</h2>
					<p>
						Placera wants help you find anything you want or need. Are you looking for a pediatrician, a nice sushi bar, a car wash, a mechanic, a gym, a photographer, a nurse, a clown, etc, etc...? Well, you can do it here.
					</p>
					<p>
						We want to provide people with an easy and practical way to find the products or services that they are looking for.How many times have been looking for something (again, product or service) but you didn't know where to find it? You go and search in Google but you see mostly ads and only places that have an web site (of course) but that are not exactly what you're looking for or that are not near to you.
					</p>
					<p>
						So we want to make this easier for everyone. Just open the application, type what YOU NEED to find near to you and get the best results based in the recommendations of thousands of other people that have previously been there or that have previously used that service.
					</p>
				</div>

					<h2>It's all about places, products and services</h2>
					<p>
						There are awesome <strong>places</strong>  out there that you can visit, let's say restaurants, bars, zoos, theaters... Yeah the list is huge.
						But there are lots of those places that you can't get to know if it's not because a friend tells you about them or because you discovered them since they are not on the internet. Well, we think they deserved to be discovered and you deserve to know them as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						The same thing happens to <strong>products</strong> that are built, prepared or created in an specific place. If they are good, they should be put in the map. Let's say mostly small kiosks that often offer a variety of products but they are not in the internet.
					</p>
					<p>
						And last but not least important <strong>services</strong>. There are thousands of people out there that can do something useful for you give classes, walk your dog, fix your washing machine, clean your house, but once again, they remain anonymous due to the lack of ways to promote their services. This is what we are here for, just look for an specific service on the map and you'll get a list of all the people that offer that service near to you. 
					</p>

				<h2>Spread the word</h2>
				<p>
					This application is basically feed by the people that use it and the service providers. It's important to add as much detailed information as possible to let everyone know which place they should go to, if the product they're going to buy has a good quality or if the service they are planning to hire is good.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is why we believe in people and in the general knowledge that is out there in everyone's experiences.

								<div class="accordion-inner">
									The main idea of the application is to help other people discover the places you've been to. If you want you can select to show your name as the person that added the place or to show it as anonymous. What is important for us is the location of the place and what you have to say about it.

							<div id="collapseTwo" clasS="accordion-body collapse">
								<div class="accordion-inner">
									If a place was great, it deserves to be well known. If a place is bad and you have a bad experience there (we're sorry) it's important for other people to know that as well.
